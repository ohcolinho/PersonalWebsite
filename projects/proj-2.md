title: 'Slip-Pad: A haptic slip display'
---
I researched and developed a novel haptic display for rendering fngertip slip forces that could be used to improve the performance of telerobotic surgery and virtual reality systems

Work presented and published at [IEEE World Haptics 2015](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7177712/)
