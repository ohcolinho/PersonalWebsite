title: 'MSLED: Micro Subglacial Lake Exploration Device'
---
I led a team of 12 interdisciplinary engineers and scientists in the development and field testing of the world's smallest deep access robotic submersible (MSLED) that was the frst to explore and investigate deep subglacial lakes in Antarctica. [MSLED](http://www.wissard.org/node/259) was part of the Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling expedition (WISSARD), funded by the National Science Foundation.
